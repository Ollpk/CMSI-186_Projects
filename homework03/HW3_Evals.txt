Evaluation for homework 03: Dice Game

Die, DiceSet, and HighRoll Program
   Includes running DieAndDiceSetTestHarness
   Includes running automated HighRoll tests
============================================

The Die.java class must exist.  It needs to have a constructor that
takes one argument for the number of sides for the die object.  There
must be some sort of "roll()" method.  There must be a "getValue()"
method that returns the current value of the die.  There moust be two
"toString()" methods, one static [class] method and one instance method.
The static method must take a Die object as its argument.  There must be
a main method, which has been provided, and it must have at least one
test of the Die class in it, but preferably more [like 10].

The DiceSet.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes the number of dice and the number of sides as arguments.  There
must be a "sum()" method that returns the integer sum of all the dice in
the set, as well as a "roll()" method to roll all the dice in the set.
A separate "rollIndividual()" method must exist, taking one argument that
is the index of the Die object to roll.  There must be a "getIndividual()"
method to get the value of a single Die object from the set.  There needs
to be both a class method "toString()" which takes an argument which is
another DiceSet, and an instance method "toString()" which has no argument.
There must be a method "isIdentical()" which takes an argument which is
another DiceSet and returns a boolean based on whether the two sets are
considered identical.  It is your choice as to how "deep" to go when you
make the comparison.  There must be a "main()" method, which is provided
to you, but you must add at least two tests into it.

The HighRoll.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor for
the class that initializes the game.  You must determine the number of
dice and the number of sides from the command line, and you must check
that the input is appropriate.  Any incorrect inputs must cause the
program to output an error message before ending the program.  There must
be a TUI menu that is displayed in every iteration of the program loop,
and which must have the six selections as stated in class and on the web
page program specification.  There are two points total [1 point for
each] awarded for argument checking, which covers:

   - right number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion [no letters]

Testing includes the 17 test sections in the provided test harness called
"DieAndDiceSetTestHarness.java" which will be run to verify the methods
all work properly and will be worth a total of 5 points.  The input to
the TUI menu must consist of the numbers of the selections, except for
the last selection which should be a 'q' for 'quit'.  The batch/shell
script file used for testing will be run on the HighRoll game and there
are 4 points awarded, one for each test.  Output from all testing will
thus be captured to a "testresults.txt" file which will be uploaded to
your repo as part of evaluation for the assignment.

There must be three files in your repo: Die.java, DiceSet.java, and the
HighRoll.java files.


A total of one point each for the following, except where noted:

Total 37 out of 37 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score:
Total 37 out of 37 = 100% which is an A-plus

Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
Nice work on this one, Jake!  Just a couple of notes:

You had your getIndividual take an index that was zero-based, so I adapted
the test harness to compensate.  One thing to consider would be to have the
code automatically adjust the input for the zero index and let the user enter
a "1" for the lowest index when dealing with array-based items.

The second thing is to give your user a little more information, by putting
out a display of the current dice states after every move.  This wasn't a
specific requirement, but is the kind of thing you should think about doing
so I left it to each of you to decide on your own.

Finally, when you select to roll a single die, it is not obvious to the user
that the second parameter is needed when it is not asked for.  The program
actually throws an exception which is a little unsettling to users; it might
be worth considering catching the exception and displaying a message to the
user so a second chance is provided.

Other than that, excellent!!  Keep up the good work!
