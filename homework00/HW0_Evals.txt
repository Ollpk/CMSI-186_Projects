Evaluation for homework 00: Greeter
   and Java Environment set up
   and GitHub repository set up/initialization
============================================

There must be a GitHub repository to which you have invited your humble
professor to collaborate.  The structure of the repository must be as is
specified in the assignment, including the name of the repo.  There must
be a "Greeter.java" source code file in the repository.  You do not need
to include the "Greeter.class" file unless you want to do so.  It will
be assumed that you have a working editor of some kind to create your
code and that it is configured correctly [no "funny" characters].  It will
also be assumed that you have a working Java installation so that your
compiler and JVM can execute your code.

============================================================================
Evaluation:
============================================================================
Maximum points: 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus

Java works        1.00 out of 1.00
Repo created      2.00 out of 2.00
Editor works      1.00 out of 1.00
Greeter runs      2.00 out of 2.00
Greeter in Repo   2.00 out of 2.00

Your score:
Total 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus


Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
Just a subtle note: be careful about your indenting to make sure that all
the lines are indented the same number of spaces.  You have the curly
braces at the end of the file all in the same column.  Braces are supposed
to show the beginning and ending of blocks, and the closing brace should
align with the first character of the line that starts that block.  Plus
anything inside that block should be indented one more time.  Here's an
example:

IS:
public class Greeter {

  public static void main( String [] args ) {

  System.out.println( "Hello World!" ) ;
}
}

SHOULD BE:
public class Greeter {

  public static void main( String [] args ) {

    System.out.println( "Hello World!" );

  }
}

Also, be sure to use spaces, not tabs, when indenting.

Great start and nice work!
